/* ================================================================================
   Main Page Layout & Typography
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   This section establishes the core look and behavior of the entire site:
   1. Sets a clean, widely supported sansâ€‘serif font stack for readability.
   2. Uses Flexbox on the body to stack header, main content, and footer vertically.
   3. Ensures the page always fills at least the full viewport height so the footer
      stays at the bottom, even on short pages.
