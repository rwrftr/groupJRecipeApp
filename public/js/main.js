// main.js
// -------------------------
// This script wires up all interactive features on the page:
// - Boots up Bootstrap tooltips and popovers
// - Validates forms before they submit
// - Shows image previews when a user selects a file
// - Handles the star‐based rating UI
// - Filters and sorts recipes based on user clicks
// - Auto‐closes alert messages after a timeout
// The code logic itself is unchanged—only comments have been expanded
// to explain what each part does in plain, human‐friendly language.
